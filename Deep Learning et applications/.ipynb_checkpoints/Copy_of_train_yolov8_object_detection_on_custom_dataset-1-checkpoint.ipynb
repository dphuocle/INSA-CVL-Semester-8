    "Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics. The YOLOv8 model is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. It can be trained on large datasets and is capable of running on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.\n",

    "YOLOv8 is still under heavy development. Breaking changes are being introduced almost weekly. We strive to make our YOLOv8 notebooks work with the latest version of the library. Last tests took place on **03.01.2024** with version **YOLOv8.0.196**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Creating project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.\n",

    "  >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Uploading images\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, add the data to your newly created project. You can do it via API or through our [web interface](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/object-detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you drag and drop a directory with a dataset in a supported format, the Roboflow dashboard will automatically read the images and annotations together.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img\n",
    "    width=\"640\"\n",

    "  >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only have images, you can label them in [Roboflow Annotate](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img\n",

    "  >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Generate new dataset version\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our images and annotations added, we can Generate a Dataset Version. When Generating a Version, you may elect to add preprocessing and augmentations. This step is completely optional, however, it can allow you to significantly improve the robustness of your model.\n",

    "  >\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Exporting dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dataset version is generated, we have a hosted dataset we can load directly into our notebook for easy training. Click `Export` and select the `YOLO v5 PyTorch` dataset format.\n",
